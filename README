== DESCRIPTION:

Injection is a simple dependency injection plugin for rails. It allows you to inject objects into your controllers and observers which have been described in a yaml file (config/objects.yml).

* http://atomicobjectrb.rubyforge.org/injection

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:
  
* Declarative dependency injection that automatically instantiants ivars via the objects.yml file

== SYNOPSIS:
 To specify objects to be injected from the DIY context into your controller or observer
 use the inject class method:

   inject :one_component, :another

=== Example

 This example defines a context with two objects, _foo_ and _bar_, which 
 are injected into every instance of the WidgetController or WidgetObserver.  The objects 
 are available as instance variables within the controller and observer.
 
 config/objects.yml:
   ---
   foo:
   bar:
 
 lib/foo.rb:
   class Foo
     ...
   end
 
 lib/bar.rb:
   class Bar
     ...
   end
 
 app/controllers/widget_controller.rb:
   class WidgetController < ApplicationController
     inject :foo, :bar
 
     def index
       render :text => "{@foo.inspect} {@bar.inspect}"
     end
   end
  
 app/models/widget_observer.rb:
   class WidgetObserver < ActiveRecord::Observer
     inject :foo, :bar
     
     before :save do |widget|
      @foo.bar(widget)
      @bar.foo(widget)
     end
   end 
 
=== Declarative Observations
 
 Observations on an active record object can be specified in a declarative way using
 the before and after class methods. The methods are invoked with a
 symbol which specifies what kind of event the observer is interested in, and a block 
 that defines what actions it will perform.
 
   class WidgetObserver < ActiveRecord::Observer
     before :update do |record|
       ...
     end
 
     after :create do |record|
       ...
     end
 
     after :validation, :on => :create do |record|
       ...
     end
 
     before :validation, :on => [:create, :update] do |record|
       ...
     end
   end
